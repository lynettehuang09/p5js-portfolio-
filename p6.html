          For this assignment, 
          I spent a week tracking my schedule of when to start and end working in a day, a record of my energy level, and created a data-self portrait.
          In the graphic, the start and end points of the waves show the time frame, and the fluctuations demonstrate my energy level.

        Reflection
      </h1>
  
      <p>
        Given by this assignment, 
        I had the opportunity to record my working time 
        and to visually see how it reflects my energy level 
        on that day and the next day. As you could see in the graphic, 
        a heavy work day on Thursday definitely affected my energy level 
        and productivity on Friday. Being able to see the connection on 
        the visualized data, it eased my panic of worrying about not doing 
        enough and not being able to finish projects as soon as possible. 
        It definitely reminded me of the importance of taking a break that 
        helped me to reduce stress while working, and that overload work had 
        really affected my performance and stress levels.
