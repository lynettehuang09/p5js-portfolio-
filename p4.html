          Exquisite corpse is a surrealist technique where players take turns to draw a portion of a figure while not being able to see what has already been drawn by other players. 
          For this assignment, I have exchanged the body parts with my partners:Beatriz Ribeiro and KT Son, and assembled into one figure showing above.

         <p>
           Combined with my partnerâ€™s body parts, I got my new housekeeping fairy. 
           He has a cooking pot head and a vacuum tail. He gets thrilled when the owner(cursor) is interacting with him.
           He loves human, and he tries to look more humanized with his favorite Nike hoodie.

        Reflection
      </h1>
  
      <p>
        By introducing customized functions,I realized the importance of the structure for coding. 
        Before, my coding was process oriented, which is following my drawing process, coded step by step, 
        layer by layer from the bottom to the front. With customized functions and function.this, 
        I was able to start structure coding to object oriented, by making them out of objects that interact with one another. 
        However, I think that I still have a long journey to simplify my code and program in a much more efficient way.
