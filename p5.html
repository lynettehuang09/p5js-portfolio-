          When I was watching the tutorial of “secret message” by Xin Xin, 
          I immediately thought about the disappearing messages on Chinese social media under the online censorship.
          Instead of a traditional decorative pattern from China, I chose to express an opinion towards a series of 
          absurd news happened based on Online Censorship which I believe is becoming a new 'tradition' for this generation. 
          Thus, I drew three concepts to replicate these moments.

          Finally, I chose the image of Winnie the Pooh and the story of how it’s been banned in China because of 
          the jokes around the cartoon character and our president. 
          The “secret message” effect created by for loop here is revealing the concept. 
          The story and image of Winnie the Pooh has been hided on mass media platform.
          The red sign of exclamation mark often appear when some articles have been deleted or banned on Wechat platform - the main communication application in China.

        Reflection

      <p>
        When I was coding the shirt of exclamation signs, 
        I realized that it was just like weaving a knit sweater for Winnie. 
        The loops make the work so much easier and faster. 
        However, it was hard for me to constrain the signs within the outline of the shirt shape, 
        so I ended up coding each horizontal lines separatly.<br>
        In terms of the cultural refrence behind the pattern, it was designed to make more tangible with the issues of censorship, to protest for a
more transparent society, and to refuses to let the questions disappear.

         The outline of Winnie was created based on a converter tool from Adobe Illustrator to p5js.
