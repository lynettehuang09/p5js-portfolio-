        Since the context in my camera discusses around Privacy and Human Rights, I had to pay extra attention on the FRIES principles on my website. 
          <br>
        First of all, I wanted to ensure the <strong>Freely Given & Reversible & Informed</strong> principles, which are especially essential when asking for Camera Access. 
          I wanted my viewers to be able to choose if they wanted to give camera access, and give them options to interact with this project either way. 
          Under the case that the user might not want to be enable Camera, I created another scene that they could have similiar experience with a default photo. 
          <br>
          The users also have the option to go back to setting and change their decision on Camera Access by clicking "Go Back" button.
          <br>
          In terms of <strong>Specific</strong> principle, I added some introductions of what the camera does and clarified that the data wouldn't be stored or used at any end.

        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        During the coding process, I have came up with more ideas than at the design stage. For example, when I only had two buttons of "agree" or "decline" camera access,
        I realized that it was not enough to inform the users that this website requires Camera Access, so I created another agreement button that asks the users' permission 
        on Camera Access before they go into the camera mode. I hope in this way, the users are aware of this consent and wouldn't turn on get into camera mode by accident.
