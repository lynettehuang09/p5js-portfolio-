        GAME - "New American Dream"
      </h1>
 
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <h3>
          Background Story 
        </h3>
        <p>
          This game reflects my personal journey of chasing the new “American Dream” since I came alone to North America when I was 15 years old. 
          Unlike a few generations before, we international students nowadays face new challenges which are quite routined, such as language challenge, 
          cultural differences, visa struggles, job application barriers, etc. <br>
          Instead of making the game too literal and depressing, I decided to hide the narrative behind the story of a tangerine’s travel journey.  
          The little tangerine wants to travel to a lemon tree and tries to root and grow there. The challenging journey was splitted to two chapters:<br>
         </p>
        <b>
          The first level- avoiding hitting the “bugs”;
        </b>
        <p>
        The various “bugs” demonstrate some external and physical obstacles I faced after coming abroad, 
          such as the language challenge at the beginning, cultural difference in every aspect, reduced j
          ob opportunities, or the h1b visa lottery challenge, etc. They were designed to be continuously 
          coming up because the challenges I faced were additive as well. One challenge does not disappear 
          because the other one shows up, and I had to conquer all of them by myself.
        </p>
        <b>
          The second level- catching the water drops before the monster “lemon” gets you.
        </b>
        <p>
        The “Lemon” more demonstrates the internal and mental obstacles. 
          There was the feeling of loneliness, stress, loss, and nostalgia I had to deal with, 
          even though I am growing in this journey as well. It was only one huge monster because 
          the feelings are always mixed up together. Hustling under the mixed feeling, I get to find myself and my identity here in the US. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I first came up with the narrative I wanted to tell and drew the storyboard which had a totally different vibe than the final representation. 
          However, the gaming logic was pretty much decided which leads to the grey box coding.
        </p>
      
        <h3>
         Grey Box

        <p>
        “Object-Oriented Programming” finally made sense here in this experience. 
        Also, it helped go through the logic of coding and practice the terminology and other methods.        
        </p>
        
        <h3>
         Look and Feel
        </h3>
        <p>
         At the Grey Box stage, I was able to concentrate on programming and made the game work. After getting out of that struggle, 
          I rethought about the game settings and how I wanted to present this story, this is when the idea of look and feel prototype 
          kicks in. Since I wanted to deliver a chill and cheerful experience, the visuals needed to be quite colorful and childish-looking 
          and the background music had to be fun, so I started to illustrate the characters and the settings, and found my sound.

         Play Test and Iterations
        </h3>
        <p>
          I invited a couple of friends to play my game. They provided really solid suggestions for improving it, 
          such as having the instruction page inside of the game instead of putting on my glitch page. Or the bugs 
          could be varied since they represent different obstacles. I iterated the game several times according to the comments I received. 
          It was a short and small game but I was surprised how much it could develop upon.

        Reflection
      </h1>
  
      <p>
        I really enjoyed and appreciated this project. Not only I gained more confidence in coding, 
        but also experienced the simple but comprehensive game design process from storyboard, prototype, programming, 
        set design, play tests and iterations. Creating this game helped me understand deeper meanings of games, which can tell stories, 
        convey more emotions and powerful representations than entertaining only. They are small worlds created for others to experience and find connections. 
        They are immersive art mediums.
