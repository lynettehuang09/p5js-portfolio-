        Design Process

        <p>
          "SKYNET" is the surveillance system of installing cameras in China connected to facial recognition algorithms. 
          “Chinese state-run media has claimed Skynet can scan the entire Chinese population in one second 
          with 99.8 percent accuracy, yet such claims ignore glaring technical limitations.” CSET Research Analyst Dahlia Peterson says.
          <br>
          Thus, I wanted to design this camera to invite people look into the screen and expeirence the dehumanization by cameras and algorithms.
          One might debate that this system is built to recognize criminals for a safer environment. However, as we thought ourselves not being effected by "acting good",
          the system is connecting to a lot of programs that's affecting our daily lives in every aspects, such as the social credit program.
          <br>
          Through this project, I want to visualize the fact that human beings are being perceived as data. As well as we thought that we might be invisible under the system while there's no way out.
        </p>

        <p>
         I had three ideas of how to visualize the feeling of being watched. The first one demonstrates that the gestures will be caught under
         the "net" when certain amount of pixels showing up in the camera and putting together the images of the viewer. 
         
         The second idea is that the camera will capture the contour of human body by detecting the motion and put on a constraining rope.
         
         The third idea is that the eye shapes will be the modules that capture and put together the human bodies. 
         <br>
         My final presentation combines the first and the third idea. The human beings are fragments under the camera within the eye shape, 
         indicating that we are all just data under this survalliance system. At the end there is the "spider web" for us whether or not it's visible.

        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        Through this assignment, I strongly felt that as technology develops, human beings are perceived in different ways. 
        Cameras capture portraits through the lenses in which we are only a certain amount of lights.  
        Coding programs use parameterised face templates to locate or detect the faces. 
        Algorithms on social media and commercial platforms put people in groups by identifying several similarities. 
        In this project, human being are read as dots and shapes just as data.
        There is terrible invisibility in so many aspects in this survelliance systems and through that we lose our identities.
