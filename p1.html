      <p>
       It's a graphic demonstration of my partner-Tricia's lost mitten. <br>
        - A mitten shaped <br>
        - Turquoise Color <br>
        - Multiple simple graphics of sunny side up egg and they are all different shapes<br>
        - Yolk is bright yellow and egg white is white<br>
        - Hand shaped, with no fingers and only thumbs<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        I firstly started to visualize the object based on her written words,then deconstrusted the graphic into 2D primitive shpaes. 
        Other than code the object, I also wanted to have some shadows to demonstrate my drawing progress.

<!--         The language your partner used to describe the image
        Your interpretation of the image
        The depiction of the image using code
        The differences in interpretation at all stages of the assignment -->
        
<!--  Assignment 1 explores this ambiguity in human language as well as the gap between human language and computer language.  -->

        Coding  my partner’s lost project is a progress of translating, communicating and visualizing that starts between Tricia and me, and ends with me and the computer. I found that human languages are more communications of expressions, delivering thoughts, questions and answers, and goes both ways. Wheres coding language evaluate human’s direct instructions to the computer that needs high degree of expertise, precision, and directness. As a new-bee at coding, I found that I needed to have the basic understanding of the functions and solve my problems around them. For instance, instead of telling the program to draw an irregular oval shape for the egg yolks, I had to get into the curve and shape functions to find the best one to execute that instruction, which is a fun learning and exploring experience.
