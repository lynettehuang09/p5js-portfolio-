           I feel time differently in my day. 
          It also refreshes at 1 am everyday, when I usually go to bed. 
          It goes fast when I’m asleep or chilling; it goes s…l…o…w… when I have too much to do or studying. 
          For example, 1-2am is slow and tortured, because everything happened on that day would quickly run again in my mind, 
          when I also try to fall asleep. 
          And when I’m finally asleep, time just become fuzzy and chaotic for the next few hours. 
          Or, I always feel time is super long in the morning, that I could complete so many tasks 
          and it would still be in the morning. 
          But sometimes it feels too slow that I am drowning, 
          especially when class is going on and on and there’s no time for lunch. 
          Thus, I drew this clock to visualize my flow in a day. 
          I condensed my 24 hour into 129 second, 
          and I hope you could feel the time with me.

        I chose my clock out from these two other options. 
        One is my meal-reminder-box, that I view my day in all different kinds of meal. 
        The other one is a visualization of how time disappears that all these bars representing 
        hour, minute, second would just fade away.

         I ended up with my melting clock because I wanted to record my feelings about how my schedule and rhythm has changed after the school starts, and my struggles of adjusting the new flow.
        <br>
        In order to code the time circles for my clock, I was experimenting with millies(), and I had to test a lot of times just by re-play the animation and wait, to see if it’s landed with the exact number. However, I think there must be a smarter way.
