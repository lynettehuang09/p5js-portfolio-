           I had several iterations of drawings, some with organic lines within a irregular face outline. I wished to generate different amount of lines showing in the outline with the random()function and mousePressed(). However, figuring out how to define each starting and ending point for the organic lines as variables is still too challenging for me. <br><br>
I then started to think of other fun options that could be interactive with these functions. Making grimace faces it is! Based on my experience with the last project, I coded the faces combining 2D Primitives and quadraticVertex().  Using the variable, random() and mousePressed function, I coded the moving tongue and changing eyes for this funny face. 
Inspired by our in-class mouse sims activity, I added the grid and changing background color as extra details, to convey the fun and vibrant feeling.

        When I first started to code the drawing last week,I was confused since I thought that there were much more applications that would make drawing easier than coding. However, in this project, I started to understand the charm of coding with these fun interactions! I designed the faces based on my understanding of the capability of these functions we learned, and started to find the connections between coding and design goals. Being able to see all the awesome works from my peer on the Open Projector section was also eye-opening for me to see the wide possiblities with p5js, which certainly boosted my interests into computation. With this project, I also felt less confused and gained more confidence in coding when I was done.
